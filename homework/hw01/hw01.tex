\begin{enumerate}
\item Transforming a NFA with $n$ states into a DFA may require as
  many as $2^n$ states.  Give examples of NFAs with 2 and 3 states
  that {\em require} 4 and 8 states, respectively, in their
  equivalent DFAs. Use the alphabet $\Sigma=\{0,1\}$.  Explain why
  they require $2^n$ states and find the DFAs in question.
\item
  Let
  \[
  \Sigma=\left\{\duple{0}{0},\duple{0}{1},\duple{1}{0},\duple{1}{1}\right\}.
  \]
  So $\Sigma$ contains all columns of 0s and 1s of height two.  A
  string of symbols in $\Sigma$ give two rows of 0s and 1s.  Consider
  each row to be a binary number and let
  \[
  C = \{w\in\Sigma^* | \mbox{the bottom row is three times the top
    row}\}.
  \]
  For example, $\duple 00\duple 01 \duple 11 \duple 00\in C$ because
  the binary number 0110 is three times the binary number 0010,
  but
  $\duple 01 \duple01\duple10\not\in C$ because the binary number 110
  is not three times the binary number 001.  Show that $C$ is
  regular.

  For this problem
  you may assume the truth of the theorem that says
  that the reverse of a regular language
  is regular.  The reverse of a language $A$, written $A^R$,
  is the set of all strings
  $w^R=w_n\ldots w_2w_1$ such that $w=w_1w_2\ldots w_n\in A$,
  \[
  A^R = \{w^R |  \mbox{ $w^R=w_n\ldots w_2w_1$ where  $w=w_1w_2\ldots
    w_n\in A$}\},
  \]

\item Let $\Sigma$ be as in the previous problem, and let
  \[
  E=\{w\in\Sigma^*|\mbox{the bottom row of $w$ is the reverse of the
    top row of $w$}\}.
    \]
    Show that $E$ is not regular.
