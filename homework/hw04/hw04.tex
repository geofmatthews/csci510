\begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $A$ be a Turing-recognizable language consisting of Turing
    machines, $\{\langle M_1 \rangle, \langle M_2\rangle, \ldots\}$,
    where every $M_i$ is a decider.  Prove that some decidable
    language $D$ is not decided by any decider $M_i$ whose description
    appears in $A$.

    \item Let $A= \{\langle R\rangle | $ $R$ is a regular
      expression describing a language containing at least one string
      $w$ that has  $111$  as a substring ({\em i.e.} $w=x111y$ for
      some $x$ and $y$ $\}$.  Show that $A$ is decidable.

    \item Let $A= \{\langle R, S\rangle |$ $R$ and $S$ are regular
      expressions and $L(R) \subseteq L(S)\}$.  Show that $A$ is
      decidable. 

\end{enumerate}
